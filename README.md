The card will include various elements such as an image, text, and buttons. The design will be highly responsive and interactive,
with hover effects that bring the card to life. The goal of the project is to showcase how CSS before and after elements can be used to create
visually stunning designs in React and provide a foundation for developers to build upon and customize for their own projects.
